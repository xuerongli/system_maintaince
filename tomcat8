Tomcat 运行慢

（2）At least one JAR was scanned for TLDs yet contained no TLDs



The warning comes up because Tomcat scans all Jars for TLDs (Tagging Library Definitions).

Step1: To see which JARs are throwing up this warning, insert he following line to tomcat/conf/logging.properties

org.apache.jasper.servlet.TldScanner.level = FINE

Now you should be able to see warnings with a detail of which JARs are causing the intial warning

Step2 Since skipping unneeded JARs during scanning can improve startup time and JSP compilation time, we will skip un-needed JARS in the catalina.properties file. You have two options here -

    List all the JARs under the tomcat.util.scan.StandardJarScanFilter.jarsToSkip. But this can get cumbersome if you have a lot jars or if the jars keep changing.
    Alternatively, Insert tomcat.util.scan.StandardJarScanFilter.jarsToSkip=* to skip all the jars

You should now not see the above warnings and if you have a considerably large application, it should save you significant time in deploying an application.

Note: Tested in Tomcat8
